# Code maintenance
learning_tf.py has updated system paths ("templates/[template]/[run_name]/...")
- update other files accordingly
  [ ] learning_pyswmm?
  [ ] swmm_timeseries
  [ ] simulation_extractor
  [ ] simulation_sampler
  [ ] swmm_utils

# Validation against SWMM
look at individual elements' time series of capacity (comparison between est. and SWMM output)
investigate error propagation (run for > one 15 min increment)
- look at time series where one step's outputs lead to next step's inputs

# Putting model onto live server
[x] create initial conditions file - light, med, heavy rain
  o- select relevant periods from monitor station data
  o- input one week time series, ending on 24 hours of desired rain, into ICM model
  o- match node invert depth to monitor station (DFINAL??)
[ ] create method to extract a single time from a SWMM output file
[ ] create method to convert volume info (ICM links) into capacity info (SWMM/NEWC links)

[ ] write script to record rain observed
[ ] write script to translate recent observations + predicted rain levels into model input dataframe

[x] move model keras files to VM
[ ] modify crontab to run
  - gather forecast
  - gather recent rain
  - generate initial model inputs (choose initial state file + recent rain, modulate with noise terms)
  - execute model swarm
  - compile estimates
  - record as a feature layer for Map on S3 bucket
